## Funding

Katsu Metadata service development is funded by CANARIE under the CHORD project.

## Architecture

Katsu Metadata Service is a service to store epigenomic metadata.

1. Patients service handles anonymized individualâ€™s data (individual id, sex, age or date of birth)
    * Data model: aggregated profile from GA4GH Phenopackets Individual, FHIR Patient and mCODE Patient.

2. Phenopackets service handles phenotypic and clinical data
    * Data model: [GA4GH Phenopackets schema](https://github.com/phenopackets/phenopacket-schema)

3. mCode service handles patient's oncology related data.
    * Data model: [mCODE data elements](https://mcodeinitiative.org/)

4. Experiments service handles experiment related data.
    * Data model: derived from [IHEC Metadata Experiment](https://github.com/IHEC/ihec-ecosystems/blob/master/docs/metadata/2.0/Ihec_metadata_specification.md#experiments)

5. Resources service handles metadata about ontologies used for data annotation.
    * Data model: derived from Phenopackets Resource profile

6. CHORD service  handles metadata about dataset, has relation to phenopackets (one dataset can have many phenopackets)
    * Data model: [DATS](https://github.com/datatagsuite)  + [GA4GH DUO](https://github.com/EBISPOT/DUO)

7. Rest api service handles all generic functionality shared among other services


## REST API highlights

* Standard api delivers data in snake_case.
To retrieved data in json compliant with phenopackets that uses camelCase append `?format=phenopackets` .

* Data can be ingested and retrieved in snake_case or camelCase.

* Other available renderers:
Phenopackets model is mapped to [FHIR](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/) using
[Phenopackets on FHIR](https://aehrc.github.io/fhir-phenopackets-ig/) implementation guide.
To retrieve data in fhir append `?format=fhir` .

* Ingest endpoint: `/private/ingest`.


## Install

Install the git submodule for DATS JSON schemas (if you did not clone recursively):

```
git submodule update --init
```

The service uses PostgreSQL database for data storage.

* Create and activate virtual environment
* Run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* To configure the application (such as the DB credentials) we are using python-dotenv:
    - Take a look at the .env-sample file at the root of the project
    - You can export these in your virtualenv or simply `cp .env-sample .env`
    - python-dotenv can handle either (a local .env will override env vars though)


* Run:

```
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```

* Development server runs at `localhost:8000`

## Authentication

Default authentication can be set globally in `settings.py`

```python
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_AUTHENTICATION_CLASSES': [
    	'rest_framework.authentication.BasicAuthentication',
    	'rest_framework.authentication.SessionAuthentication',
    ]
}
# ...
AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = ["django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend"]
```

By default, the service ships with a custom remote user middleware and backend
compatible with the CHORD project. This middleware isn't particularly useful
for a standalone instance of this server, so it can be swapped out.

### Note On Permissions

By default, `chord_metadata_service` uses the CHORD permission system, which
functions as follows:

  * URLs under the `/private` namespace are assumed to be protected by an
    **out-of-band** mechanism such as a properly-configured reverse proxy.
  * Requests with the headers `X-User` and `X-User-Role` can be authenticated
    via a Django Remote User-type system, with `X-User-Role: owner` giving
    access to restricted endpoints and `X-User-Role: user` giving less trusted,
    but authenticated, access.

This can be turned off with the `CHORD_PERMISSIONS` environment variable and/or
Django setting, or with the `AUTH_OVERRIDE` Django setting.

### Authorization inside CanDIG

When ran inside the CanDIG context, to properly implement authorization you'll
have to do the following:

1. Make sure the CHORD_PERMISSIONS is set to "false"
2. Set INSIDE_CANDIG to "true"
3. Provide the URL for the OPA instance in CANDIG_OPA_URL

## Developing

### Branching

All new feature requests and non-critical bug fixes should be merged into the
`develop` branch. `develop` is treated as a "nightly" version. Releases are
created from `develop`-to-`master` merges; patch-release work can be branched
out and tagged from the tagged major/minor release in `master`.

### Tests

Tests are located in tests directory in an individual app folder.

Run all tests and linting checks for the whole project:

```bash
tox
```

Run all tests for the whole project:

```bash
python manage.py test
```

Run tests for an individual app, e.g.:

```bash
python manage.py test chord_metadata_service.phenopackets.tests.test_api
```

Test and create `coverage` HTML report:

```bash
tox
coverage html
```

### Accessing the Django Shell from inside a CHORD Container

Assuming `chord_singularity` is being used, the following commands can be used
to bootstrap your way to a `katsu` environment within a CHORD
container:

```bash
./dev_utils.py --node x shell
source /chord/services/metadata/env/bin/activate
source /chord/data/metadata/.environment
export $(cut -d= -f1 /chord/data/metadata/.environment)
DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=chord_metadata_service.metadata.settings django-admin shell
```

From there, you can import models and query the database from the REPL.
