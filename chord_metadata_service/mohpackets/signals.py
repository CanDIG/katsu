    This module contains the SIGNALS for the MoH Models.
    Due to the change to include UUID in each models, the UUID and FK have to be either provided
    upon ingest or in katsu before saving the object
    The pre_save signal should check this saving process before saving to the database
    to ensure the the FK is properly link:
    - If there is no donor_uuid, need to find the Donor and link it
    - If donor_uuid exists, continue
